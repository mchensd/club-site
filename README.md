# club-site
CCA Programming Club Website: Club members can view announcements, post in forums to ask questions, and view their competition results.

Created using Django, and PostgreSQL database to store Users, contests, and announcement posts. Especially enjoyed implementing
separation of admin and regular club member accounts, since admin accounts had full power over announcements and contests.
